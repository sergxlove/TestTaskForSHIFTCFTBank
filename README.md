# TestTaskForSHIFTCFTBank

## About: 

This project is a solution to a test assignment for a developer position. The task was to create a fully functional banking system, including designing the PostgreSQL database structure and implementing business logic in C#. As part of the assignment, all the requirements were met: from creating DDL scripts for customer tables, products, accounts, and transactions to writing complex analytical queries and financial transaction processing procedures.

The solution demonstrates the skills of working with relational databases, understanding the banking logic of processing loans, deposits and card transactions, as well as the ability to design and implement complex SQL queries and stored procedures. Special attention is paid to the correctness of data processing, transactional integrity and automation of banking processes, which meets the requirements of modern financial systems.
